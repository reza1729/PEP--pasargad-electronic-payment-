# Rectangle Saver!

Hi! I'm Reza Ahmadi. This is a task about **saving rectangle** with any share property with main rectangle.


# 1-install Node

www.nodejs.com

## 2-Copy .env in root is not required
Of course I placed .env in my project due to lack of any important data exposing.

# 3-Copy in terminal
npm i
npm run build
npm start

## Removed Features
I removed some features intentionally to make project lighter like:
Cors, RateLimmiter and lots of security packages...
